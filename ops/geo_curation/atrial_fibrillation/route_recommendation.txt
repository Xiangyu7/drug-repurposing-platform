Disease: atrial fibrillation (atrial_fibrillation)
GSE found: 1 (high=1, med=0, low=0)
Route: DIRECTION_A_LOW_CONFIDENCE
Action: Direction A can run but will produce LOW confidence results (single-study, no cross-validation). Consider supplementing with manual GEO search or using Direction B as primary.
Direction A (signature): YES
Direction B (origin-only): YES (always available)
Warning: Only 1 GSE: meta-analysis degrades to single-study stats. sign_concordance and I² heterogeneity are not available. Signature reliability is limited.
