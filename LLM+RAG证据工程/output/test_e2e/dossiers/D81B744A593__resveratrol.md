- PMID:34830366 | Natural Compound Resveratrol Attenuates TNF-Alpha-Induced Vascular Dysfunction in Mice and Human Endothelial Cells: The Involvement of the NF-κB Signaling Pathway. (2021)
  - Abstract: Resveratrol, a natural compound in grapes and red wine, has drawn attention due to potential cardiovascular-related health benefits. However, its effect on vascular inflammation at physiologically achievable concentrations is largely unknown. In this study, resveratrol in concentrations as low as 1 μm suppressed TNF-α-induced monocyte adhesion to human EA.hy926 endothelial cells (ECs), a key event in the initiation and development of atherosclerosis. Low concentrations of resveratrol (0.25-2 μm) also significantly ...
- PMID:40686105 | [Research progress on cardiovascular protective mechanism of resveratrol]. (2025)
  - Abstract: Resveratrol(Res) is a kind of polyphenolic compound, possessing multiple biological activities such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, and anticancer effects. In recent years, the cardiovascular protective mechanism of Res has become a research hotspot. Studies have shown that Res has a protective effect on the cardiovascular system through various pathways, such as inhibiting oxidative stress, regulating ferroptosis of cells, improving ischemia-reperfusion(I/R) injury, regulating lipid metabolism...
- PMID:30469326 | Beneficial Effects of Resveratrol Administration-Focus on Potential Biochemical Mechanisms in Cardiovascular Conditions. (2018)
  - Abstract: Resveratrol (RV) is a natural non-flavonoid polyphenol and phytoalexin produced by a number of plants such as peanuts, grapes, red wine and berries. Numerous in vitro studies have shown promising results of resveratrol usage as antioxidant, antiplatelet or anti-inflammatory agent. Beneficial effects of resveratrol activity probably result from its ability to purify the body from ROS (reactive oxygen species), inhibition of COX (cyclooxygenase) and activation of many anti-inflammatory pathways. Administration of the...
- PMID:28346848 | Cardiovascular Protective Effects and Clinical Applications of Resveratrol. (2017)
  - Abstract: Resveratrol is a naturally occurring phenol that is generated by plant species following injury or attack by bacterial and fungal pathogens. This compound was first described as the French Paradox in 1992. Later in 2003, resveratrol was reported to activate sirtuins in yeast cells. Recent experimental studies have found that resveratrol offers a variety of benefits that include both anticarcinogenic and anti-inflammatory effects in addition to the ability to reverse obesity, attenuate hyperglycemia and hyperinsulin...
- PMID:30253861 | Effect of resveratrol on seric vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations during atherosclerosis. (2018)
  - Abstract: Although it is known that resveratrol has anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic actions, its effect on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in atherosclerosis is unknown. To evaluate the effect of resveratrol on serum concentrations of VEGF during the progression and evolution of atherosclerosis, as well as and its evolution over time in rabbits fed with a cholesterol diet. A total of 48 New Zealand white male rabbits were randomly divided into four groups of 12 rabbits: group1 (control): standard diet (comme...
- PMID:21261638 | Resveratrol in cardiovascular health and disease. (2011)
  - Abstract: Resveratrol, initially used for cancer therapy, has shown beneficial effects against most degenerative and cardiovascular diseases from atherosclerosis, hypertension, ischemia/reperfusion, and heart failure to diabetes, obesity, and aging. The cardioprotective effects of resveratrol are associated with its preconditioning-like action potentiated by its adaptive response. During preconditioning, small doses of resveratrol can exert an adaptive stress response, forcing the expression of cardioprotective genes and pro...
- PMID:29044265 | A comprehensive review of the health perspectives of resveratrol. (2017)
  - Abstract: Many natural products present in our diet, including flavonoids, can prevent the progression of cancer and other diseases. Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol present in various fruits and vegetables, plays an important role as a therapeutic and chemopreventive agent used in the treatment of various illnesses. It exhibits effects against different types of cancer through different pathways. It additionally exerts antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant effects in a variety of cell types. Furthermore, the ca...
- PMID:11408943 | Mechanism of cardioprotection by resveratrol, a phenolic antioxidant present in red wine (Review). (2001)
  - Abstract: Coronary heart disease (CHD) has been and remains a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in developed countries. The most common form of CHD in the western world is atherosclerosis (AS), especially of the major coronary arteries. Failure to maintain an intact endothelium, as a result of episodic and/or persistent injury and perturbation of the vascular endothelium, promotes formation of fatty streaks which are considered initiation events of AS. Cellular constituents contributing to endothelial injury inclu...
- PMID:21530968 | Resveratrol prevents the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm through attenuation of inflammation, oxidative stress, and neovascularization. (2011)
  - Abstract: We sought to examine the effect of resveratrol (3,4',5-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene), a plant-derived polyphenolic compound, on the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). AAA was induced in mice by periaortic application of CaCl(2). NaCl (0.9%)-applied mice were used as a sham group. Mice were treated with intraperitoneal injection of PBS (Sham/CON, AAA/CON, n=30 for each) or resveratrol (100 mg/kg/day) (AAA/RSVT, n=30). Six weeks after the operation, aortic tissue was excised for further examinations. Aortic...
- PMID:20850033 | Dietary polyphenols: focus on resveratrol, a promising agent in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases and control of glucose homeostasis. (2010)
  - Abstract: Plants continuously produce an extraordinary variety of biologically active low-molecular-mass compounds. Among them, resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) is endowed with significant positive activities by protecting against cardiovascular diseases and preventing the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, the molecule significantly ameliorates glucose homeostasis in obese mice. These beneficial effects have driven considerable interest towards resveratrol molecular activities, and intensive...
