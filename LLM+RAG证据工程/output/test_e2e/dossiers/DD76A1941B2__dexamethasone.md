- PMID:1811546 | Role of inflammatory responses in initiation of atherosclerosis: effects of anti-inflammatory drugs on cuff-induced leukocyte accumulation and intimal thickening of rabbit carotid artery. (1991)
  - Abstract: Immediately after a cuff-sheathing of rabbit carotid artery, a large number of leukocytes adhered to injured endothelium then infiltrated into the media. These inflammatory responses were followed by an atherosclerotic change, intimal thickening, of the artery. A simultaneous injection of dexamethasone (10 mg/kg i.m.) inhibited the leukocyte accumulation by 74% when evaluated 18 h thereafter. Similarly, 39% inhibition was obtained with the same dose of FR110302, a potent 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor. On the other hand,...
- PMID:33217190 | Mechanisms of a Sustained Anti-inflammatory Drug Response in Alveolar Macrophages Unraveled with Mathematical Modeling. (2020)
  - Abstract: Both initiation and suppression of inflammation are hallmarks of the immune response. If not balanced, the inflammation may cause extensive tissue damage, which is associated with common diseases, e.g., asthma and atherosclerosis. Anti-inflammatory drugs come with side effects that may be aggravated by high and fluctuating drug concentrations. To remedy this, an anti-inflammatory drug should have an appropriate pharmacokinetic half-life or better still, a sustained anti-inflammatory drug response. However, we still...
- PMID:25874855 | Co-treatment of Pitavastatin and Dexamethasone Exacerbates the High-fat Diet-induced Atherosclerosis in apoE-deficient Mice. (2015)
  - Abstract: Activation of macrophage adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (FABP4) induces development of atherosclerosis in animal models. We previously reported that statin inhibited while dexamethasone activated macrophage FABP4 expression. However, co-treatment of macrophages with statin and dexamethasone induced FABP4 expression in a synergistic manner, which implies that this co-treatment may exacerbate high-fat diet (HFD)-induced atherosclerosis. In this study, we fed apoE-deficient (apoE) mice with HFD or HFD containing...
- PMID:32051336 | Endothelial cell-glucocorticoid receptor interactions and regulation of Wnt signaling. (2020)
  - Abstract: Vascular inflammation is present in many cardiovascular diseases, and exogenous glucocorticoids have traditionally been used as a therapy to suppress inflammation. However, recent data have shown that endogenous glucocorticoids, acting through the endothelial glucocorticoid receptor, act as negative regulators of inflammation. Here, we performed ChIP for the glucocorticoid receptor, followed by next-generation sequencing in mouse endothelial cells to investigate how the endothelial glucocorticoid receptor regulates...
- PMID:38235556 | Exosomes From IgE-Stimulated Mast Cells Aggravate Asthma-Mediated Atherosclerosis Through circRNA CDR1as-Mediated Endothelial Cell Dysfunction in Mice. (2024)
  - Abstract: IgE has been known for mediating endothelial cell dysfunction and mast cell (MC) activation to fuel asthma-aggravated high-fat diet-induced atherosclerosis. However, it remains unclear for the mechanism of asthma-mediated atherosclerosis, especially the potential involvement of IgE in the exacerbation of asthma-mediated atherosclerosis with a standard laboratory diet, and the cross talk between endothelial cells and MCs. Asthma-mediated atherosclerosis mice models under a standard laboratory diet and FcεR1 knock-ou...
- PMID:40185321 | FKBP5 mediates glucocorticoid signaling in estrogen deficiency-associated endothelial dysfunction. (2025)
  - Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality among postmenopausal women, with atherosclerosis being a major underlying factor. Endothelial dysfunction, a key initiating event in atherosclerosis, can be triggered by hormonal and metabolic changes. While estrogen deficiency has been linked to increased cardiovascular risk, the molecular mechanisms by which it exacerbates endothelial dysfunction, particularly in the presence of elevated glucocorticoid levels, remain poorly understood. This study aims...
- PMID:28406431 | Prevention of Oxidized Low Density Lipoprotein-Induced Endothelial Cell Injury by DA-PLGA-PEG-cRGD Nanoparticles Combined with Ultrasound. (2017)
  - Abstract: In general, atherosclerosis is considered to be a form of chronic inflammation. Dexamethasone has anti-inflammatory effects in atherosclerosis, but it was not considered for long-term administration on account of a poor pharmacokinetic profile and adverse side effects. Nanoparticles in which drugs can be dissolved, encapsulated, entrapped or chemically attached to the particle surface have abilities to incorporate dexamethasone and to be used as controlled or targeted drug delivery system. Long circulatory polymeri...
- PMID:29670468 | Analysis of Drug Effects on Primary Human Coronary Artery Endothelial Cells Activated by Serum Amyloid A. (2018)
  - Abstract: RA patients have a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases compared to the general population. Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an acute-phase protein, upregulated in sera of RA patients. To determine the effects of medications on SAA-stimulated human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC). HCAEC were preincubated for 2 h with medications from sterile ampules (dexamethasone, methotrexate, certolizumab pegol, and etanercept), dissolved in medium (captopril) or DMSO (etoricoxib, rosiglitazone, meloxicam, fluvastatin, ...
- PMID:15820441 | Isoform-specific modulation of coronary artery PKC by glucocorticoids. (2005)
  - Abstract: Glucocorticoids (GC) exert diverse cellular effects in response to both acute and chronic stress, the functional consequences of which have been implicated in the development of cardiovascular pathology such as hypertension and atherosclerosis. However, the mechanisms by which GCs activate divergent signaling pathways are poorly understood. The present study examined the direct effects of natural (cortisol) and synthetic (dexamethasone) GCs on protein kinase C (PKC) isoform expression in coronary arteries. Porcine ...
- PMID:9444616 | Endothelin-1 stimulates the biosynthesis of tumour necrosis factor in macrophages: ET-receptors, signal transduction and inhibition by dexamethasone. (1997)
  - Abstract: Endothelin-1 (ET-1) enhances the biosynthesis of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in endothelial cells and bone marrow-derived stromal cells of the rat. This study investigates (i) whether ET-1 stimulates the formation of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) or interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) in cultured macrophages or in the anaesthetized rat. Incubation of J774.2 macrophages with ET-1 (0.001-1 microM) caused a concentration- and time-dependent increase in the concentration of TNF alpha, but not of IFN gamma, in the culture ...
