        "title": "Role of inflammatory responses in initiation of atherosclerosis: effects of anti-inflammatory drugs on cuff-induced leukocyte accumulation and intimal thickening of rabbit carotid artery.",
        "abstract": "Immediately after a cuff-sheathing of rabbit carotid artery, a large number of leukocytes adhered to injured endothelium then infiltrated into the media. These inflammatory responses were followed by an atherosclerotic change, intimal thickening, of the artery. A simultaneous injection of dexamethasone (10 mg/kg i.m.) inhibited the leukocyte accumulation by 74% when evaluated 18 h thereafter. Similarly, 39% inhibition was obtained with the same dose of FR110302, a potent 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor. On the other hand, the same dose of indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, had little effect on the leukocyte accumulation. The intimal thickening which was evaluated 3 weeks after the cuff-treatment was attenuated by a daily dose (10 mg/kg i.m.) of dexamethasone or FR110302 but not by one of indomethacin. The inhibition by the two former drugs were 91 and 58%, respectively. In vitro, the three drugs in concentrations up to 10 microM hardly affected endothelial adhesion of PMN which was induced by LPS or IL-1. Though 10 microM of FR110302 and indomethacin significantly decreased PMN chemotaxis induced by LTB4, the decreases were less than that at 10 microM dexamethasone. These results confirm a possible linkage between inflammation and atherosclerosis, and suggest that 5-lipoxygenase products contribute to the initiation and development of atherosclerosis.",

        "abstract": "Both initiation and suppression of inflammation are hallmarks of the immune response. If not balanced, the inflammation may cause extensive tissue damage, which is associated with common diseases, e.g., asthma and atherosclerosis. Anti-inflammatory drugs come with side effects that may be aggravated by high and fluctuating drug concentrations. To remedy this, an anti-inflammatory drug should have an appropriate pharmacokinetic half-life or better still, a sustained anti-inflammatory drug response. However, we still lack a quantitative mechanistic understanding of such sustained effects. Here, we study the anti-inflammatory response to a common glucocorticoid drug, dexamethasone. We find a sustained response 22 hours after drug removal. With hypothesis testing using mathematical modeling, we unravel the underlying mechanism-a slow release of dexamethasone from the receptor-drug complex. The developed model is in agreement with time-resolved training and testing data and is used to simulate hypothetical treatment schemes. This work opens up for a more knowledge-driven drug development to find sustained anti-inflammatory responses and fewer side effects.",

        "abstract": "Activation of macrophage adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (FABP4) induces development of atherosclerosis in animal models. We previously reported that statin inhibited while dexamethasone activated macrophage FABP4 expression. However, co-treatment of macrophages with statin and dexamethasone induced FABP4 expression in a synergistic manner, which implies that this co-treatment may exacerbate high-fat diet (HFD)-induced atherosclerosis. In this study, we fed apoE-deficient (apoE) mice with HFD or HFD containing dexamethasone or pitavastatin or both for 16 weeks. Compared with HFD alone, pitavastatin or dexamethasone had little effect on lesions in both en face aortas and aortic root cross sections. However, the co-treatment exacerbated HFD-induced lesions. In addition, the co-treatment decreased collagen content and disturbed the integrity of lesion caps. Both serum total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels were reduced by pitavastatin and increased by dexamethasone, respectively. However, the co-treatment had little effect on both total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels, indicating that the exacerbation of lesions is independent of total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol levels. FABP4 expression in aortic lesion area was significantly induced by the co-treatment, suggesting that activation of FABP4 expression is a main contributor to lesions. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that co-treatment of pitavastatin and dexamethasone exacerbates HFD-induced atherosclerosis and defines a potential risk to use the dual treatment for patients in clinics.",

        "abstract": "Vascular inflammation is present in many cardiovascular diseases, and exogenous glucocorticoids have traditionally been used as a therapy to suppress inflammation. However, recent data have shown that endogenous glucocorticoids, acting through the endothelial glucocorticoid receptor, act as negative regulators of inflammation. Here, we performed ChIP for the glucocorticoid receptor, followed by next-generation sequencing in mouse endothelial cells to investigate how the endothelial glucocorticoid receptor regulates vascular inflammation. We identified a role of the Wnt signaling pathway in this setting and show that loss of the endothelial glucocorticoid receptor results in upregulation of Wnt signaling both in vitro and in vivo using our validated mouse model. Furthermore, we demonstrate glucocorticoid receptor regulation of a key gene in the Wnt pathway, Frzb, via a glucocorticoid response element gleaned from our genomic data. These results suggest a role for endothelial Wnt signaling modulation in states of vascular inflammation.",

        "abstract": "IgE has been known for mediating endothelial cell dysfunction and mast cell (MC) activation to fuel asthma-aggravated high-fat diet-induced atherosclerosis. However, it remains unclear for the mechanism of asthma-mediated atherosclerosis, especially the potential involvement of IgE in the exacerbation of asthma-mediated atherosclerosis with a standard laboratory diet, and the cross talk between endothelial cells and MCs. Asthma-mediated atherosclerosis mice models under a standard laboratory diet and FcεR1 knock-out mice were used to determine the role of IgE-FcεR1 signaling in asthma-mediated atherosclerosis, which was assessed by Oil Red O staining and immunohistochemistry. Various in vitro assays including nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy were used to evaluate exosome characteristics. Immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization approaches were used to evaluate the effect and mechanism of MC-secreted exosomes encapsulated circular RNA CDR1as (cerebellar degeneration-related 1 antisense) on endothelial cells in vivo and in vitro. Finally, cohort studies examined the plasma CDR1as levels in patients with atherosclerosis with or without allergies. Asthma mice with a standard laboratory diet showed increased atherosclerotic lesions and inflammatory infiltration depending on IgE-FcεR1 signal. FcεR1 knockout mice and blockage of IgE-FcεR1 signaling with IgE monoclonal antibody, omalizumab, all significantly alleviated asthma-mediated atherosclerosis and vascular inflammatory remodeling. Anti-inflammation with dexamethasone and stabilization of MC with cromolyn partially alleviated atherosclerotic lesions and mitigated the inflammatory infiltration in arteries. Mechanistically, IgE stimulation upregulates MC CDR1as expression in exosomes and upregulates the endothelial cell adhesive factors VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) and ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1) via the CDR1as-FUS (fused in sarcoma)-phos-p65 axis. Knockdown of CDR1as in vivo significantly decreased the endothelial adhesion function and mitigated asthma-mediated atherosclerosis. Furthermore, a cohort study indicated higher plasma CDR1as levels in patients with atherosclerosis with allergies than in patients with atherosclerosis and healthy controls. Exosomes from IgE-stimulated MCs aggravated atherosclerosis through circular RNA CDR1as-mediated endothelial dysfunction, providing a novel insight into asthma-mediated atherosclerosis and potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets.",

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality among postmenopausal women, with atherosclerosis being a major underlying factor. Endothelial dysfunction, a key initiating event in atherosclerosis, can be triggered by hormonal and metabolic changes. While estrogen deficiency has been linked to increased cardiovascular risk, the molecular mechanisms by which it exacerbates endothelial dysfunction, particularly in the presence of elevated glucocorticoid levels, remain poorly understood. This study aims to explore the role of FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5) in mediating glucocorticoid-induced endothelial dysfunction in estrogen-deficient females. Estrogen deficiency was developed in female mice by ovariectomy (OVX). Female mice and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with dexamethasone (DEX) to mimic elevated cortisol levels in vivo and vitro. Endothelial function of the mice aorta was assessed using wire myography. Oxidative stress and inflammation were evaluated through reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection, immunofluorescence and mRNA expression analysis. The selective FKBP5 inhibitor SAFit2 was used to study the functional role of FKBP5 in these processes. Estrogen deficiency contributed to endothelial dysfunction in female mice, an effect exacerbated by elevated glucocorticoid levels. FKBP5 expression was upregulated in both ovariectomized mice aortas and DEX-treated endothelial cells. Inhibition of FKBP5 reversed endothelial dysfunction, reduced ROS levels, and suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, including ICAM-1, IL-1β, TNF-α, and NF-κB. FKBP5 mediates glucocorticoid-induced endothelial dysfunction under estrogen-deficient conditions. Inhibition of FKBP5 represents a promising therapeutic strategy to ameliorate endothelial dysfunction and improve vascular health in estrogen-deficient women.",

        "abstract": "In general, atherosclerosis is considered to be a form of chronic inflammation. Dexamethasone has anti-inflammatory effects in atherosclerosis, but it was not considered for long-term administration on account of a poor pharmacokinetic profile and adverse side effects. Nanoparticles in which drugs can be dissolved, encapsulated, entrapped or chemically attached to the particle surface have abilities to incorporate dexamethasone and to be used as controlled or targeted drug delivery system. Long circulatory polymeric nanoparticles present as an assisting approach for controlled and targeted release of the encapsulated drug at the atherosclerotic site. Polymeric nanoparticles combined with ultrasound (US) are widely applied in cancer treatment due to their time applications, low cost, simplicity, and safety. However, there are few studies on atherosclerosis treatment using polymeric nanoparticles combined with US. In this study, targeted dexamethasone acetate (DA)-loaded poly (lactide-glycolide)-polyethylene glycol-cRGD (PLGA-PEG-cRGD) nanoparticles (DA-PLGA-PEG-cRGD NPs) were prepared by the emulsion-evaporation method using cRGD modified PLGA-PEG polymeric materials (PLGA-PEG-cRGD) prepared as the carrier. The average particle size of DA-PLGA-PEG-cRGD NPs was 221.6 ± 0.9 nm. Morphology of the nanoparticles was spherical and uniformly dispersed. In addition, the DA released profiles suggested that ultrasound could promote drug release from the nanocarriers and accelerate the rate of release. In vitro, the cellular uptake process of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)@DA-PLGA-PEG-cRGD NPs combined with US into the damaged human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) indicated that US promoted rapid intracellular uptake of FITC@DA- PLGA-PEG-cRGD NPs. The cell viability of DA-PLGA-PEG-cRGD NPs combined with US reached 91.9% ± 0.2%, which demonstrated that DA-PLGA-PEG-cRGD NPs combined with US had a positive therapeutic effect on damaged HUVECs. Overall, DA-PLGA-PEG-cRGD NPs in combination with US may provide a promising drug delivery system to enhance the therapeutic effects of these chemotherapeutics at the cellular level.",

Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an acute-phase protein, upregulated in sera of RA patients. To determine the effects of medications on SAA-stimulated human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC). HCAEC were preincubated for 2 h with medications from sterile ampules (dexamethasone, methotrexate, certolizumab pegol, and etanercept), dissolved in medium (captopril) or DMSO (etoricoxib, rosiglitazone, meloxicam, fluvastatin, and diclofenac). Human recombinant apo-SAA was used to stimulate HCAEC at a final 1000 nM concentration for 24 hours. IL-6, IL-8, sVCAM-1, and PAI-1 were measured by ELISA. The number of viable cells was determined colorimetrically. SAA-stimulated levels of released IL-6, IL-8, and sVCAM-1 from HCAEC were significantly attenuated by methotrexate, fluvastatin, and etoricoxib. Both certolizumab pegol and etanercept significantly decreased PAI-1 by an average of 43%. Rosiglitazone significantly inhibited sVCAM-1 by 58%. We observed marked influence of fluvastatin on lowering cytokine production in SAA-activated HCAEC. Methotrexate showed strong beneficial effects for lowering released Il-6, IL-8, and sVCAM-1. Interesting duality was observed for NSAIDs, with meloxicam exhibiting opposite-trend effects from diclofenac and etoricoxib. This represents unique insight into specific responsiveness of inflammatory-driven HCAEC relevant to atherosclerosis.",

However, the mechanisms by which GCs activate divergent signaling pathways are poorly understood. The present study examined the direct effects of natural (cortisol) and synthetic (dexamethasone) GCs on protein kinase C (PKC) isoform expression in coronary arteries. Porcine right coronary arteries were treated in vitro for 18 h in the presence and absence of either dexamethasone (10, 100, or 500 nM) or cortisol (50, 125, 250, or 500 nM). PKC isoform levels and subcellular distribution were determined by immmunoblotting of whole cell homogenates and immunocytofluorescence using PKC-alpha, -betaII, -epsilon, -delta, and -zeta specific antibodies. Dexamethasone caused a approximately 4-fold increase in PKC-alpha, a approximately 2.5-fold increase in PKC-betaII, and a 2-fold increase in PKC-epsilon (p<0.05). In contrast, dexamethasone had no effect on PKC-delta or PKC- zeta levels. Dexamethasone also caused an increase in the activity of PKC-alpha (285%), -betaII (170%), and -epsilon (210%). Cortisol produced similar effects on PKC isoform expression. Confocal microscopy revealed that while dexamethasone altered localization patterns for PKC-alpha, -betaII and -epsilon, no such effect was observed for PKC-delta or PKC-zeta. The stimulatory effects of dexamethasone and cortisol on coronary PKC levels and translocation were prevented by the GC receptor (GR) blocker, RU486. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that GCs modulate coronary PKC expression and subcellular distribution in an isoform-specific manner through a GR-dependent mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Endothelin-1 (ET-1) enhances the biosynthesis of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in endothelial cells and bone marrow-derived stromal cells of the rat. This study investigates (i) whether ET-1 stimulates the formation of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) or interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) in cultured macrophages or in the anaesthetized rat. Incubation of J774.2 macrophages with ET-1 (0.001-1 microM) caused a concentration- and time-dependent increase in the concentration of TNF alpha, but not of IFN gamma, in the culture medium. The increase in TNF alpha caused by stimulation of J774.2 macrophages was abolished by pretreatment of cells with (i) the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, (ii) with the selective ETA-receptor antagonists BQ-123 or BQ-485 (but not the selective ETB-receptor antagonist BQ-788), (iii) the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein or tyrphostin AG126, or (iv) with the glucocorticoid, dexamethasone. The inhibition by dexamethasone of the formation of TNF alpha by cells activated with ET-1 is not due to the formation of lipocortin-1 (LC1), as it was not reduced by a monoclonal antibody against LC1. Systemic administration (i.v.) of ET-1 (1 nmol.kg-1) to anaesthetized rats caused a rapid and sustained (maximum: 45 min; return to baseline: within 180 min) rise in the plasma levels of TNF alpha. This is the first demonstration that ET-1 can release proinflammatory cytokines in vitro and in vivo. The generation of TNF alpha caused by ET-1 involves (in sequence) the (i) activation of ETA-receptors, (ii) activation of tyrosine kinase resulting in the phosphorylation of intracellular proteins, (iii) the activation of, hitherto, unknown transcription factors, finally resulting in (iv) transcription and translation of the TNF alpha gene. The generation of TNF alpha by cells activated with ET-1 points to a pro-inflammatory role of ET-1 in diseases associated with local (e.g. atherosclerosis, heart failure) or systemic inflammation (circulatory shock), which are associated with high ET-1 plasma levels.",
