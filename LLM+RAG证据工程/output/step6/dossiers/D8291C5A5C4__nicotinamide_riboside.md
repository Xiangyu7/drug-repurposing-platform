- PMID:35453391 | Sirtuin 3 Dependent and Independent Effects of NAD + to Suppress Vascular Inflammation and Improve Endothelial Function in Mice. (2022)
  - Abstract: Atherosclerosis is initiated by endothelial cell dysfunction and vascular inflammation under the condition of hyperlipidemia. Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + )-dependent mitochondrial deacetylase, which plays a key role in maintaining normal mitochondrial function. The present study tested whether endothelial-selective SIRT3 deletion accelerates vascular inflammation and oxidative stress, and assessed the protective effect of NAD + to alleviate these changes in endothelial cells and ...
- PMID:40143060 | Nicotinamide Mononucleotide and Nicotinamide Riboside Improve Dyslipidemia and Fatty Liver but Promote Atherosclerosis in Apolipoprotein E Knockout Mice. (2025)
  - Abstract: Background: Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and nicotinamide riboside (NR) are intermediary products in NAD+ metabolism. NMN and NR supplementation can elevate NAD+ levels in tissues, addressing health issues associated with aging and obesity. However, the impact of NMN and NR on atherosclerosis remains incompletely elucidated. Methods: C57BL/6J and Apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE -/- ) mice were used to explore the impact of NMN and NR supplementation on serum lipids, fatty liver, and atherosclerosis. Additional...
- PMID:40459998 | Nicotinamide Riboside Supplementation Benefits in Patients With Werner Syndrome: A Double-Blind Randomized Crossover Placebo-Controlled Trial. (2025)
  - Abstract: Werner syndrome (WS) is a rare hereditary progeroid syndrome caused by mutations in the WRN gene. Patients frequently develop various age-associated diseases prematurely, often leading to early mortality (&#x2264;&#x2009;60&#x2009;years of age). Depletion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) + has been reported in patients with WS, suggesting a key role in the pathogenesis of WS. NAD + supplementation may improve the condition of WS and other accelerated aging diseases. Therefore, we conducted a double-blind,...
- PMID:40215896 | NAD + boosting increases atherosclerotic plaques and inflammation in Apoe knockout mice. (2025)
  - Abstract: NAD + (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is a cosubstrate of the sirtuins (SIRT) that are activated upon caloric restriction. Supplementing NAD + precursors such as nicotinamide riboside (NR) has been reported to extend life span and combat metabolic syndrome through pan-sirtuin activation in mice. Notably, sirtuins compete with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)1 and CD38 for NAD + . Supplementing NAD + precursors did not improve cardiovascular outcome in the AIM-HIGH trial. Recently, the terminal NAD + metaboli...
- PMID:32075942 | Long noncoding RNA SNHG12 integrates a DNA-PK-mediated DNA damage response and vascular senescence. (2020)
  - Abstract: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging regulators of biological processes in the vessel wall; however, their role in atherosclerosis remains poorly defined. We used RNA sequencing to profile lncRNAs derived specifically from the aortic intima of Ldlr -/- mice on a high-cholesterol diet during lesion progression and regression phases. We found that the evolutionarily conserved lncRNA small nucleolar host gene-12 ( SNHG12 ) is highly expressed in the vascular endothelium and decreases during lesion progression. S...
- PMID:35196876 | Rewiring Vascular Metabolism Prevents Sudden Death due to Aortic Ruptures-Brief Report. (2022)
  - Abstract: The goal of this study was to determine whether boosting mitochondrial respiration prevents the development of fatal aortic ruptures triggered by atherosclerosis and hypertension. Ang-II (angiotensin-II) was infused in ApoE (Apolipoprotein E)-deficient mice fed with a western diet to induce acute aortic aneurysms and lethal ruptures. We found decreased mitochondrial respiration and mitochondrial proteins in vascular smooth muscle cells from murine and human aortic aneurysms. Boosting NAD levels with nicotinamide ri...
- PMID:32758058 | Modulation of Energy Sensing by Leucine Synergy with Natural Sirtuin Activators: Effects on Health Span. (2020)
  - Abstract: Sirt1 and 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) are energy-sensing systems that work cooperatively and regulate mitochondrial biogenesis and fuel metabolism, and mediate, in part, the salutary effects of caloric restriction on lifespan and healthspan. We have shown that leucine activates Sirt1 and enables synergy with sirtuin co-activators. Resveratrol is a widely recognized activator of Sirt1; however, poor bioavailability and rapid metabolism limit effective clinical translation of promising ...
- PMID:39034866 | Systemic aging fuels heart failure: Molecular mechanisms and therapeutic avenues. (2025)
  - Abstract: Systemic aging influences various physiological processes and contributes to structural and functional decline in cardiac tissue. These alterations include an increased incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, a decline in left ventricular diastolic function, left atrial dilation, atrial fibrillation, myocardial fibrosis and cardiac amyloidosis, elevating susceptibility to chronic heart failure (HF) in the elderly. Age-related cardiac dysfunction stems from prolonged exposure to genomic, epigenetic, oxidative, au...
- PMID:40257024 | Novel Molecules Targeting Metabolism and Mitochondrial Function in Cardiac Diseases. (2025)
  - Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death worldwide, creating the need for new therapeutic strategies targeting the pathological processes involved. Mitochondria, which comprise one-third of cardiac cell volume, maybe a potential therapeutic target for CVD. Known primarily for energy production, mitochondria are also involved in other processes including intermediary metabolism, mitophagy, calcium homeostasis, and regulation of cell apoptosis. Mitochondrial function is closely linked to morpholog...
