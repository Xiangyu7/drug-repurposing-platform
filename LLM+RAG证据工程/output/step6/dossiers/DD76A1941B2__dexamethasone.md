- PMID:1811546 | Role of inflammatory responses in initiation of atherosclerosis: effects of anti-inflammatory drugs on cuff-induced leukocyte accumulation and intimal thickening of rabbit carotid artery. (1991)
  - Abstract: Immediately after a cuff-sheathing of rabbit carotid artery, a large number of leukocytes adhered to injured endothelium then infiltrated into the media. These inflammatory responses were followed by an atherosclerotic change, intimal thickening, of the artery. A simultaneous injection of dexamethasone (10 mg/kg i.m.) inhibited the leukocyte accumulation by 74% when evaluated 18 h thereafter. Similarly, 39% inhibition was obtained with the same dose of FR110302, a potent 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor. On the other hand,...
- PMID:17715567 | Glucocorticoids and oxidative stress. (2007)
  - Abstract: Glucocorticoids (GC) are used widely for the treatment of patients with various disorders, including autoimmune diseases, allergies, and lymphoproliferative disorders. Glucocorticoid therapy is often limited by several adverse reactions associated with GC excess. Excess GC can elicit a variety of symptoms and signs, including growth retardation in children; immunosuppression; cardiovascular disorders like hypertension and atherosclerosis; osteoporosis; myopathy; and diabetes mellitus. Currently, attention is focuse...
- PMID:33217190 | Mechanisms of a Sustained Anti-inflammatory Drug Response in Alveolar Macrophages Unraveled with Mathematical Modeling. (2020)
  - Abstract: Both initiation and suppression of inflammation are hallmarks of the immune response. If not balanced, the inflammation may cause extensive tissue damage, which is associated with common diseases, e.g., asthma and atherosclerosis. Anti-inflammatory drugs come with side effects that may be aggravated by high and fluctuating drug concentrations. To remedy this, an anti-inflammatory drug should have an appropriate pharmacokinetic half-life or better still, a sustained anti-inflammatory drug response. However, we still...
- PMID:32051336 | Endothelial cell-glucocorticoid receptor interactions and regulation of Wnt signaling. (2020)
  - Abstract: Vascular inflammation is present in many cardiovascular diseases, and exogenous glucocorticoids have traditionally been used as a therapy to suppress inflammation. However, recent data have shown that endogenous glucocorticoids, acting through the endothelial glucocorticoid receptor, act as negative regulators of inflammation. Here, we performed ChIP for the glucocorticoid receptor, followed by next-generation sequencing in mouse endothelial cells to investigate how the endothelial glucocorticoid receptor regulates...
- PMID:30478968 | Molecular interaction of NF&#x3ba;B and NICD in monocyte-macrophage differentiation is a target for intervention in atherosclerosis. (2019)
  - Abstract: The activation of two transcription factors, NF&#x3ba;B and NICD (notch intracellular domain), plays a crucial role in different stages of atherosclerotic disease progression, from early endothelial activation by modified lipids like oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxyLDL) to the imminent rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque. Inflammatory mediators and the notch pathway proteins were upregulated in atherogenic diet-induced rats and the same was confirmed by the differentiation of monocyte to macrophage on exposu...
- PMID:28406431 | Prevention of Oxidized Low Density Lipoprotein-Induced Endothelial Cell Injury by DA-PLGA-PEG-cRGD Nanoparticles Combined with Ultrasound. (2017)
  - Abstract: In general, atherosclerosis is considered to be a form of chronic inflammation. Dexamethasone has anti-inflammatory effects in atherosclerosis, but it was not considered for long-term administration on account of a poor pharmacokinetic profile and adverse side effects. Nanoparticles in which drugs can be dissolved, encapsulated, entrapped or chemically attached to the particle surface have abilities to incorporate dexamethasone and to be used as controlled or targeted drug delivery system. Long circulatory polymeri...
- PMID:36035657 | Coexistence of bone and vascular disturbances in patients with endogenous glucocorticoid excess. (2022)
  - Abstract: Bone and vascular diseases are considered to share pathogenic mechanisms. Excess glucocorticoids, key regulators of cardiovascular and metabolic homeostasis, may promote both diseases simultaneously. We used endogenous Cushing's syndrome (CS) to investigate whether glucocorticoid excess underlies coexisting bone and vascular diseases. We included 194 patients with adrenal tumors (ATs): autonomous cortisol secretion (ACS, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;97) and non-functional AT (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;97). ACS was further classified into ove...
- PMID:38235556 | Exosomes From IgE-Stimulated Mast Cells Aggravate Asthma-Mediated Atherosclerosis Through circRNA CDR1as-Mediated Endothelial Cell Dysfunction in Mice. (2024)
  - Abstract: IgE has been known for mediating endothelial cell dysfunction and mast cell (MC) activation to fuel asthma-aggravated high-fat diet-induced atherosclerosis. However, it remains unclear for the mechanism of asthma-mediated atherosclerosis, especially the potential involvement of IgE in the exacerbation of asthma-mediated atherosclerosis with a standard laboratory diet, and the cross talk between endothelial cells and MCs. Asthma-mediated atherosclerosis mice models under a standard laboratory diet and Fc&#x3b5;R1 kn...
- PMID:29670468 | Analysis of Drug Effects on Primary Human Coronary Artery Endothelial Cells Activated by Serum Amyloid A. (2018)
  - Abstract: RA patients have a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases compared to the general population. Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an acute-phase protein, upregulated in sera of RA patients. To determine the effects of medications on SAA-stimulated human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC). HCAEC were preincubated for 2&#x2009;h with medications from sterile ampules (dexamethasone, methotrexate, certolizumab pegol, and etanercept), dissolved in medium (captopril) or DMSO (etoricoxib, rosiglitazone, meloxicam, fluvas...
- PMID:40185321 | FKBP5 mediates glucocorticoid signaling in estrogen deficiency-associated endothelial dysfunction. (2025)
  - Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality among postmenopausal women, with atherosclerosis being a major underlying factor. Endothelial dysfunction, a key initiating event in atherosclerosis, can be triggered by hormonal and metabolic changes. While estrogen deficiency has been linked to increased cardiovascular risk, the molecular mechanisms by which it exacerbates endothelial dysfunction, particularly in the presence of elevated glucocorticoid levels, remain poorly understood. This study aims...
