- PMID:26323267 | Dysfunctional HDL and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. (2016)
  - Abstract: High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) protect against atherosclerosis by removing excess cholesterol from macrophages through the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) pathways involved in reverse cholesterol transport. Factors that impair the availability of functional apolipoproteins or the activities of ABCA1 and ABCG1 could, therefore, strongly influence atherogenesis. HDL also inhibits lipid oxidation, restores endothelial function, exerts anti-inflammatory and ...
- PMID:32009037 | [Challenges in Drug Development Targeting Anti-atherosclerotic Proteins]. (2020)
  - Abstract: Atherosclerosis is a vascular disease responsible for acute heart attacks and stroke, which are leading causes of death not only in industrialized countries but also worldwide, and the number of patients afflicted by this disease has been increasing in Japan. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is the plasma lipoprotein that carries what is often called your "good cholesterol" through the blood. This good cholesterol moniker is associated with HDL because higher circulating levels of this lipoprotein are associated with...
- PMID:28069582 | Human apolipoprotein A-I exerts a prophylactic effect on high-fat diet-induced atherosclerosis via inflammation inhibition in a rabbit model. (2017)
  - Abstract: Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is the major functional protein fraction of high-density lipoprotein. The prophylactic effect and mechanism of human apoA-I on atherosclerosis (AS) were investigated in a high-fat diet-induced AS rabbit model. The rabbits were injected with apoA-I once a week while fed high-fat diet for 20 weeks. Our results showed that apoA-I could raise the serum level of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and reduce those of lipid total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein-choleste...
- PMID:33811580 | Apolipoprotein-AI and AIBP synergetic anti-inflammation as vascular diseases therapy: the new perspective. (2021)
  - Abstract: Vascular diseases (VDs) including pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), atherosclerosis (AS) and coronary arterial diseases (CADs) contribute to the higher morbidity and mortality worldwide. Apolipoprotein A-I (Apo A-I) binding protein (AIBP) and Apo-AI negatively correlate with VDs. However, the mechanism by which AIBP and apo-AI regulate VDs still remains unexplained. Here, we provide an overview of the role of AIBP and apo-AI regulation of vascular diseases molecular mechanisms such as vascular energy homeostas...
- PMID:29437574 | CSL112 (Apolipoprotein A-I [Human]) Enhances Cholesterol Efflux Similarly in Healthy Individuals and Stable Atherosclerotic Disease Patients. (2018)
  - Abstract: CSL112 (apolipoprotein A-I [apoA-I; human]) is a novel formulation of apoA-I in development for reduction of early recurrent cardiovascular events after acute myocardial infarction. Cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) is a marker of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) function that is strongly correlated with incident cardiovascular disease. Impaired CEC has been observed in patients with coronary heart disease. Here, we determined whether infused apoA-I improves CEC when administered to patients with stable atherosclerot...
- PMID:25170076 | Definition of human apolipoprotein A-I epitopes recognized by autoantibodies present in patients with cardiovascular diseases. (2014)
  - Abstract: Autoantibodies to apolipoprotein A-I (anti-apoA-I IgG) have been shown to be both markers and mediators of cardiovascular disease, promoting atherogenesis and unstable atherosclerotic plaque. Previous studies have shown that high levels of anti-apoA-I IgGs are independently associated with major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with myocardial infarction. Autoantibody responses to apoA-I can be polyclonal and it is likely that more than one epitope may exist. To identify the specific immunoreactive peptide...
- PMID:22986928 | Characterization of a human apolipoprotein a-I construct expressed in a bacterial system. (2012)
  - Abstract: Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is the major protein component of high density lipoproteins. This protein has key functions in lipoprotein metabolism and its plasma concentration is inversely correlated with the incidence of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. There is an increasing need to develop methods for efficient production of recombinant apoA-I for using it in basic research or pharmacological therapy. An apoA-I variant lacking two amino acid residues at the N-terminus can be easily produced by bacteri...
- PMID:16755201 | Myeloperoxidase: an inflammatory enzyme for generating dysfunctional high density lipoprotein. (2006)
  - Abstract: Evidence indicates that high density lipoprotein (HDL) is cardioprotective and that several mechanisms are involved. One important pathway is a membrane-associated ATP-binding cassette transporter, ABCA1, that clears cholesterol from macrophage foam cells. Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties also might contribute to HDL's ability to inhibit atherosclerosis. Myeloperoxidase targets HDL for oxidation, raising the possibility that the enzyme provides a specific mechanism for generating dysfunctional HDL in hu...
- PMID:21811627 | Human apolipoprotein A-I-derived amyloid: its association with atherosclerosis. (2011)
  - Abstract: Amyloidoses constitute a group of diseases in which soluble proteins aggregate and deposit extracellularly in tissues. Nonhereditary apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) amyloid is characterized by deposits of nonvariant protein in atherosclerotic arteries. Despite being common, little is known about the pathogenesis and significance of apoA-I deposition. In this work we investigated by fluorescence and biochemical approaches the impact of a cellular microenvironment associated with chronic inflammation on the folding and p...
- PMID:33327742 | Aortic Gene Expression Profiles Show How ApoA-I Levels Modulate Inflammation, Lysosomal Activity, and Sphingolipid Metabolism in Murine Atherosclerosis. (2021)
  - Abstract: HDL (high-density lipoprotein) particles are known to possess several antiatherogenic properties that include the removal of excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues, the maintenance of endothelial integrity, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. ApoA-I overexpression in apoE-deficient (EKO) mice has been shown to increase HDL levels and to strongly reduce atherosclerosis development. The aim of the study was to investigate gene expression patterns associated with atherosclerosis development in the aorta...
