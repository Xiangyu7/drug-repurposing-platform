- PMID:34830366 | Natural Compound Resveratrol Attenuates TNF-Alpha-Induced Vascular Dysfunction in Mice and Human Endothelial Cells: The Involvement of the NF-&#x3ba;B Signaling Pathway. (2021)
  - Abstract: Resveratrol, a natural compound in grapes and red wine, has drawn attention due to potential cardiovascular-related health benefits. However, its effect on vascular inflammation at physiologically achievable concentrations is largely unknown. In this study, resveratrol in concentrations as low as 1 &#x3bc;m suppressed TNF-&#x3b1;-induced monocyte adhesion to human EA.hy926 endothelial cells (ECs), a key event in the initiation and development of atherosclerosis. Low concentrations of resveratrol (0.25-2 &#x3bc;m) a...
- PMID:38958883 | Resveratrol as an Anti-inflammatory Agent in Coronary Artery Disease: A Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis and Meta-Regression. (2024)
  - Abstract: Resveratrol is a non-flavonoid polyphenol that shows promise in reducing pro-inflammatory factors and maintaining endothelial function, which hints at its potential role in slowing atherosclerosis and preventing acute coronary events. To study the cardioprotective effects of resveratrol on inflammatory mediators and endothelial function in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). A thorough search was conducted in databases (Cochrane Library, ProQuest, PubMed, LILACS, ScienceDirect, Springer, Taylor&amp;Francis...
- PMID:27144581 | Resveratrol and Cardiovascular Diseases. (2016)
  - Abstract: The increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) has stimulated research for substances that could improve cardiovascular health. Among them, resveratrol (RES), a polyphenolic compound notably present in grapes and red wine, has been involved in the "French paradox". RES is known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and for its ability to upregulate endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). RES was able to scavenge (&#x2022;)OH/O&#x2082;(&#x2022;-) and peroxyl radicals, which can limit the lipid pero...
- PMID:35526791 | Resveratrol attenuates atherosclerotic endothelial injury through the Pin1/Notch1 pathway. (2022)
  - Abstract: The present study investigates whether resveratrol could modulate the endothelial dysfunction of atherosclerosis via the Pin1/Notch1 signaling pathway. To assess the vascular endothelial cell (VECs) injury in mice, the levels of serum soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin), soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), and von Willebrand factor (vWF) were measured. Expressions of Pin1 and Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD1), both mR...
- PMID:22245452 | Cardiovascular effects and molecular targets of resveratrol. (2012)
  - Abstract: Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a polyphenol phytoalexin present in a variety of plant species and has been implicated to explain the health benefits of red wine. A wide range of health beneficial effects have been demonstrated for resveratrol in animal studies. In this review, we summarize the cardiovascular effects of resveratrol with emphasis on the molecular targets of the compound. In this regard, resveratrol stimulates endothelial production of nitric oxide, reduces oxidative stress, inhibit...
- PMID:15830334 | Resveratrol: preventing properties against vascular alterations and ageing. (2005)
  - Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in developed countries where the common pathological substrate underlying this process is atherosclerosis. Several new concepts have emerged in relation to mechanisms that contribute to the regulation of the vascular diseases and associated inflammatory effects. Recently, potential antioxidants (vitamin E, polyphenols) have received much attention as potential anti-atherosclerotic agents. Among the polyphenols with health benefic properties, resveratrol, a phyt...
- PMID:30253861 | Effect of resveratrol on seric vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations during atherosclerosis. (2018)
  - Abstract: Although it is known that resveratrol has anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic actions, its effect on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in atherosclerosis is unknown. To evaluate the effect of resveratrol on serum concentrations of VEGF during the progression and evolution of atherosclerosis, as well as and its evolution over time in rabbits fed with a cholesterol diet. A total of 48 New Zealand white male rabbits were randomly divided into four groups of 12 rabbits: group1 (control): standard diet (comme...
- PMID:30113097 | Bisphenol A vascular toxicity: Protective effect of Vitis vinifera (grape) seed extract and resveratrol. (2018)
  - Abstract: The underlying mechanism of Bisphenol A (BPA)-induced vascular toxicity and the protective role of grape seed extract (GSE) and resveratrol were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to different concentrations of GSE and resveratrol. Then, BPA was added to the cells and cell viability and effects on the protein level of cell adhesion molecules were measured through MTT and western blotting. Animals were randomly divided into control, GSE (3 and 12&#xa0;mg&#...
- PMID:35047575 | MEF2A Is the Trigger of Resveratrol Exerting Protection on Vascular Endothelial Cell. (2021)
  - Abstract: Both resveratrol and myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A) may protect vascular endothelial cell (VEC) through activating the expression of SIRT1. However, the relationship between resveratrol and MEF2A is unclear. We aimed to investigate the deeper mechanism of resveratrol in protecting vascular endothelial cells and whether MEF2A plays a key role in the protective function of resveratrol. Human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) was used for in vitro study, and small interfere RNA was used for silencing MEF2A. ...
- PMID:23927891 | Absorption of resveratrol by vascular endothelial cells through passive diffusion and an SGLT1-mediated pathway. (2013)
  - Abstract: Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol that exerts potent effects to suppress atherosclerosis. However, its low concentration in plasma has placed this role in doubt. Thus, resveratrol effects might be dependent on its transport into vascular endothelium, a question not previously addressed in spite of its obvious and fundamental importance. Via high-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, we found that resveratrol was absorbed by human umbilical vein endothelial cells in a tempe...
