- PMID:40999229 | Antibody-mediated LOX-1 inhibition in patients with residual inflammation after myocardial infarction: a randomized phase 2 trial. (2025)
  - Abstract: The lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-1 (LOX-1) is a key scavenger receptor for oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (oxLDL), which promotes inflammation and atherosclerosis. Here we evaluated MEDI6570, an antibody that acts as a LOX-1 antagonist, in a randomized, double-blind, dose-finding study in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and residual inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;1&#x2009;mg&#x2009;l -1 ). At 30-365 days after MI, 423 pa...

  - Abstract: Background Blockade of the lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) is a potentially attractive mechanism for lowering inflammatory and lipid risk in patients with atherosclerosis. This study aims to assess the safety, tolerability, and target engagement of MEDI6570, a high-affinity monoclonal blocking antibody to LOX-1. Methods and Results This phase 1, first-in-human, placebo-controlled study (NCT03654313) randomized 88 patients with type 2 diabetes to receive single ascending doses (10, 30...
