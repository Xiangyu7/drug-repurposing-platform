        "title": "Natural Compound Resveratrol Attenuates TNF-Alpha-Induced Vascular Dysfunction in Mice and Human Endothelial Cells: The Involvement of the NF-&#x3ba;B Signaling Pathway.",
        "abstract": "Resveratrol, a natural compound in grapes and red wine, has drawn attention due to potential cardiovascular-related health benefits. However, its effect on vascular inflammation at physiologically achievable concentrations is largely unknown. In this study, resveratrol in concentrations as low as 1 &#x3bc;m suppressed TNF-&#x3b1;-induced monocyte adhesion to human EA.hy926 endothelial cells (ECs), a key event in the initiation and development of atherosclerosis. Low concentrations of resveratrol (0.25-2 &#x3bc;m) also significantly attenuated TNF-&#x3b1;-stimulated mRNA expressions of MCP-1/CCL2 and ICAM-1, which are vital mediators of EC-monocyte adhesion molecules and cytokines for cardiovascular plaque formation. Additionally, resveratrol diminished TNF-&#x3b1;-induced I&#x3ba;B-&#x3b1; degradation and subsequent nuclear translocation of NF-&#x3ba;B p65 in ECs. In the animal study, resveratrol supplementation in diet significantly diminished TNF-&#x3b1;-induced increases in circulating levels of adhesion molecules and cytokines, monocyte adhesion to mouse aortic ECs, F4/80-positive macrophages and VCAM-1 expression in mice aortas and restored the disruption in aortic elastin fiber caused by TNF-&#x3b1; treatment. The animal study also confirmed that resveratrol blocks the activation of NF-&#x3ba;B In Vivo. In conclusion, resveratrol at physiologically achievable concentrations displayed protective effects against TNF-&#x3b1;-induced vascular endothelial inflammation in vitro and In Vivo. The ability of resveratrol in reducing inflammation may be associated with its role as a down-regulator of the NF-&#x3ba;B pathway.",

        "abstract": "Resveratrol is a non-flavonoid polyphenol that shows promise in reducing pro-inflammatory factors and maintaining endothelial function, which hints at its potential role in slowing atherosclerosis and preventing acute coronary events. To study the cardioprotective effects of resveratrol on inflammatory mediators and endothelial function in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). A thorough search was conducted in databases (Cochrane Library, ProQuest, PubMed, LILACS, ScienceDirect, Springer, Taylor&amp;Francis, CNKI, Wanfang, and Weipu) until September 24, 2023. The vasopro-inflammatory mediators, endothelial function and outcomes related to cardiovascular events were observed. Titles and abstracts were assessed, and bias was evaluated with Cochrane RoB 2.0. Heterogeneity of results was explored by meta-regression, certainty of evidence was assessed by the GRADE system, and conclusive evidence was enhanced by trial sequence analysis. Ten randomized controlled trials and 3 animal studies investigated resveratrol's impact on inflammatory mediators and endothelial function. In primary prevention studies, meta-analysis showed a significant reduction (95% CI: -0.73 to -0.20; P=0.0005) in tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;) expression with resveratrol, demonstrating a dose-dependent relationship. No significant difference was observed in interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression with P=0.58 for primary prevention and P=0.57 for secondary prevention. Vascular endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression was significantly increased after resveratrol pre-treatment following CAD events. Secondary prevention studies yielded no significant results; however, meta-regression identified associations between age, hypertension, and lower doses with the extent of TNF-&#x3b1; alterations. High certainty of evidence supported TNF-&#x3b1; reduction, while evidence for IL-6 reduction and eNOS elevation was deemed low. Resveratrol reduces TNF-&#x3b1; in individuals at risk for CAD, specifically 15 mg per day. However, its usefulness in patients with confirmed CAD is limited due to factors such as age, high blood pressure, and insufficient dosage. Due to the small sample size, the reduction of IL-6 is inconclusive. Animal studies suggest that resveratrol enhances endothelial function by increasing eNOS.

        "abstract": "The increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) has stimulated research for substances that could improve cardiovascular health. Among them, resveratrol (RES), a polyphenolic compound notably present in grapes and red wine, has been involved in the \"French paradox\". RES is known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and for its ability to upregulate endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). RES was able to scavenge (&#x2022;)OH/O&#x2082;(&#x2022;-) and peroxyl radicals, which can limit the lipid peroxidation processes. Moreover, in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) under glucose-induced oxidative stress, RES restored the activity of dimethylargininedimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme that degrades an endogenous inhibitor of eNOS named asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). Thus, RES could improve (&#x2022;)NO availability and decrease the endothelial dysfunction observed in diabetes. Preclinical studies have made it possible to identify molecular targets (SIRT-1, AMPK, Nrf2, NF&#x3ba;B&#x2026;); however, there are limited human clinical trials, and difficulties in the interpretation of results arise from the use of high-dose RES supplements in research studies, whereas low RES concentrations are present in red wine. The discussions on potential beneficial effects of RES in CVDs (atherosclerosis, hypertension, stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure) should compare the results of preclinical studies with those of clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "The present study investigates whether resveratrol could modulate the endothelial dysfunction of atherosclerosis via the Pin1/Notch1 signaling pathway. To assess the vascular endothelial cell (VECs) injury in mice, the levels of serum soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin), soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), and von Willebrand factor (vWF) were measured. Expressions of Pin1 and Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD1), both mRNA and protein, were also measured. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with 100&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/mL oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) were incubated with resveratrol at doses from 10&#xa0;&#x3bc;M to 40&#xa0;&#x3bc;M. Cell function was evaluated by measuring apoptosis, cell viability, lipid accumulation, and adherent human myeloid leukemia mononuclear (THP-1) cells. Resveratrol intervention in AS mice decreased the expression of serum sVCAM-1, sICAM-1, sE-selectin, sTM, and vWF and dose-dependently down-regulated Pin1 and NICD1 mRNA and protein expression in endothelial cells. Resveratrol intervention reversed ox-LDL-induced cell dysfunction by increasing viability and decreasing apoptosis, lipid accumulation, and the adhesion of THP-1 cells. These beneficial effects were reversed by the overexpression of Pin1. Resveratrol regulates endothelial cell injury of atherosclerosis by inhibiting the Pin1/Notch1 signaling pathway, suggesting novel therapeutic targets for atherosclerosis treatment.",

        "abstract": "Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a polyphenol phytoalexin present in a variety of plant species and has been implicated to explain the health benefits of red wine. A wide range of health beneficial effects have been demonstrated for resveratrol in animal studies. In this review, we summarize the cardiovascular effects of resveratrol with emphasis on the molecular targets of the compound. In this regard, resveratrol stimulates endothelial production of nitric oxide, reduces oxidative stress, inhibits vascular inflammation and prevents platelet aggregation. In animal models of cardiovascular disease, resveratrol protects the heart from ischemia-reperfusion injury, reduces blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy in hypertensive animals, and slows the progression of atherosclerosis. A number of direct and indirect target molecules mediating the aforementioned cardiovascular effects of resveratrol have been identified. These include, among others, the estrogen receptor &#x3b1;, the adenosine receptors, the cyclooxygenase 1, the histone/protein deacetylase sirtuin 1, the AMP-activated protein kinase, the Akt kinase, the nuclear factor-E2-related factor-2, and NF-&#x3ba;B. Molecular mechanisms involved in the signal cascades are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in developed countries where the common pathological substrate underlying this process is atherosclerosis. Several new concepts have emerged in relation to mechanisms that contribute to the regulation of the vascular diseases and associated inflammatory effects. Recently, potential antioxidants (vitamin E, polyphenols) have received much attention as potential anti-atherosclerotic agents. Among the polyphenols with health benefic properties, resveratrol, a phytoalexin of grape, seem to be a good candidate protecting the vascular walls from oxidation, inflammation, platelet aggregation, and thrombus formation. In this review, we focus on the mechanism of resveratrol cardiovascular benefic effects. We analyze, in relation with the different steps of atherosclerotic process, the resveratrol properties at multiple levels, such as cellular signaling, enzymatic pathways, apoptosis, and gene expression. We show and discuss the relationship with reactive oxygen species, regulation of pro-inflammatory genes including cycloxygenases and cytokines in molecular inflammatory and aging processes, and how the regulation of these activites by resveratrol can lead to a prevention of vascular diseases.",

To evaluate the effect of resveratrol on serum concentrations of VEGF during the progression and evolution of atherosclerosis, as well as and its evolution over time in rabbits fed with a cholesterol diet. A total of 48 New Zealand white male rabbits were randomly divided into four groups of 12 rabbits: group1 (control): standard diet (commercial rabbit food); group2: cholesterol diet (0.5% cholesterol); group3 (control resveratrol): standard diet (commercial rabbit food) and resveratrol (2mg/Kg); group4: cholesterol diet (0.5% cholesterol) and resveratrol (2mg/Kg), for 12weeks. Blood samples of overnight-fasted rabbits were collected at baseline and the sixth and twelfth weeks, and the lipid profile, VEGF, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were determined. Half of the animals were sacrificed on the sixth or twelfth week, and the aorta was dissected for histological studies. VEGF and CRP levels were significantly higher in groups2 and 4 than in groups1 and 3, respectively, from the 6th week (p&lt;0.001). VEGF and CRP were significantly lower in group4 than in group2 on 12th week (p&lt;0.004). Supplementation of resveratrol reduced the formation of atherosclerotic lesions. Serum VEGF and CRP levels are early markers of atherosclerosis. Oral supplementation of resveratrol exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic effects, decreasing serum concentrations of VEGF and CRP and the formation and evolution of atherosclerotic lesions.",

        "abstract": "The underlying mechanism of Bisphenol A (BPA)-induced vascular toxicity and the protective role of grape seed extract (GSE) and resveratrol were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to different concentrations of GSE and resveratrol. Then, BPA was added to the cells and cell viability and effects on the protein level of cell adhesion molecules were measured through MTT and western blotting. Animals were randomly divided into control, GSE (3 and 12&#xa0;mg&#xb7;kg -1 &#xb7;day -1 ip), resveratrol (100&#xa0;mg&#xb7;kg -1 &#xb7;day -1 ip), BPA (35&#xa0;mg&#xb7;kg -1 &#xb7;day -1 , gavage), BPA plus GSE (3, 6, and 12&#xa0;mg&#xb7;kg -1 &#xb7;day -1 ip), BPA plus resveratrol (25, 50, and 100&#xa0;mg&#xb7;kg -1 &#xb7;day -1 ip), and BPA plus vitamin E (200&#xa0;IU/kg per every other day ip). After 2&#xa0;months, contractile and relaxant responses were evaluated on the isolated aorta. BPA increased the level of aorta malondialdehyde (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) and decreased vascular responses to KCl (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.01), phenylephrine (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), and acetylcholine (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.01).

        "abstract": "Both resveratrol and myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A) may protect vascular endothelial cell (VEC) through activating the expression of SIRT1. However, the relationship between resveratrol and MEF2A is unclear. We aimed to investigate the deeper mechanism of resveratrol in protecting vascular endothelial cells and whether MEF2A plays a key role in the protective function of resveratrol. Human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) was used for in vitro study, and small interfere RNA was used for silencing MEF2A. Silencing MEF2A in the vascular endothelium (VE) of ApoE -/- mice was performed by tail injection with adeno associated virus expressing si-mef2a-shRNA. The results showed that treatment of HUVEC with resveratrol significantly up-regulated MEF2A, and prevented H 2 O 2 -induced but not siRNA-induced down-regulation of MEF2A. Under various experimental conditions, the expression of SIRT1 changed with the level of MEF2A. Resveratrol could rescue from cell apoptosis, reduction of cell proliferation and viability induced by H 2 O 2 , but could not prevent against that caused by silencing MEF2A with siRNA. Silencing MEF2A in VE of apoE -/- mice decreased the expression of SIRT1, increased the plasma LDL-c, and abrogated the function of resveratrol on reducing triglyceride. Impaired integrity of VE and aggravated atherosclerotic lesion were observed in MEF2A silenced mice through immunofluorescence and oil red O staining, respectively. In conclusion, resveratrol enhances MEF2A expression, and the upregulation of MEF2A is required for the endothelial protective benefits of resveratrol in vitro via activating SIRT1. Our work has also explored the in vivo relevance of this signaling pathway in experimental models of atherosclerosis and lipid dysregulation, setting the stage for more comprehensive phenotyping in vivo and further defining the molecular mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol that exerts potent effects to suppress atherosclerosis. However, its low concentration in plasma has placed this role in doubt. Thus, resveratrol effects might be dependent on its transport into vascular endothelium, a question not previously addressed in spite of its obvious and fundamental importance. Via high-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, we found that resveratrol was absorbed by human umbilical vein endothelial cells in a temperature-, concentration- and time-dependent manner, suggesting the involvement of passive diffusion and active transport. As determined by confocal laser scanning microscopy, resveratrol primarily distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Furthermore, resveratrol absorption was modulated by serum proteins and sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1) yet inhibited by glucose (an SGLT1 substrate) and phlorizin (an SGLT1 selective inhibitor), as well as SGLT1 siRNA transfection. Additionally, Sprague-Dawley rats were intragastrically administrated with 100mg/kg of resveratrol and the concentration of resveratrol in blood vessels declined more slowly up to 24h compared to that in the blood. Our results suggested that resveratrol uptake by vascular endothelial cells involved both passive diffusion and an SGLT1-mediated process, at least partially. Moreover, the intracellular resveratrol pool may be more important than the serum level in vivo. These provide new insights into the cardiovascular benefits of resveratrol.",
