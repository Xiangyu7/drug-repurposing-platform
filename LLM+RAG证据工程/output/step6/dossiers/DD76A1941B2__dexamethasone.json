        "abstract": "Immediately after a cuff-sheathing of rabbit carotid artery, a large number of leukocytes adhered to injured endothelium then infiltrated into the media. These inflammatory responses were followed by an atherosclerotic change, intimal thickening, of the artery. A simultaneous injection of dexamethasone (10 mg/kg i.m.) inhibited the leukocyte accumulation by 74% when evaluated 18 h thereafter. Similarly, 39% inhibition was obtained with the same dose of FR110302, a potent 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor. On the other hand, the same dose of indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, had little effect on the leukocyte accumulation. The intimal thickening which was evaluated 3 weeks after the cuff-treatment was attenuated by a daily dose (10 mg/kg i.m.) of dexamethasone or FR110302 but not by one of indomethacin. The inhibition by the two former drugs were 91 and 58%, respectively. In vitro, the three drugs in concentrations up to 10 microM hardly affected endothelial adhesion of PMN which was induced by LPS or IL-1. Though 10 microM of FR110302 and indomethacin significantly decreased PMN chemotaxis induced by LTB4, the decreases were less than that at 10 microM dexamethasone. These results confirm a possible linkage between inflammation and atherosclerosis, and suggest that 5-lipoxygenase products contribute to the initiation and development of atherosclerosis.",

        "abstract": "Glucocorticoids (GC) are used widely for the treatment of patients with various disorders, including autoimmune diseases, allergies, and lymphoproliferative disorders. Glucocorticoid therapy is often limited by several adverse reactions associated with GC excess. Excess GC can elicit a variety of symptoms and signs, including growth retardation in children; immunosuppression; cardiovascular disorders like hypertension and atherosclerosis; osteoporosis; myopathy; and diabetes mellitus. Currently, attention is focused on oxidative stress as one of the major determinants of endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular senescence. The main reason for all unwanted effects of GC is that dexamethasone induces the overproduction of reactive oxygen species, causing dysregulation of physiological processes. Humans and animals with GC-induced hypertension exhibit reduced nitric oxide levels; patients with excess GC levels also suffer from depression as a consequence of low levels of serotonin and melatonin. The common cofactor for the production of these vasoactive molecules is tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), which is required for nitric oxide synthesis.",

        "abstract": "Both initiation and suppression of inflammation are hallmarks of the immune response. If not balanced, the inflammation may cause extensive tissue damage, which is associated with common diseases, e.g., asthma and atherosclerosis. Anti-inflammatory drugs come with side effects that may be aggravated by high and fluctuating drug concentrations. To remedy this, an anti-inflammatory drug should have an appropriate pharmacokinetic half-life or better still, a sustained anti-inflammatory drug response. However, we still lack a quantitative mechanistic understanding of such sustained effects. Here, we study the anti-inflammatory response to a common glucocorticoid drug, dexamethasone. We find a sustained response 22&#xa0;hours after drug removal. With hypothesis testing using mathematical modeling, we unravel the underlying mechanism-a slow release of dexamethasone from the receptor-drug complex. The developed model is in agreement with time-resolved training and testing data and is used to simulate hypothetical treatment schemes. This work opens up for a more knowledge-driven drug development to find sustained anti-inflammatory responses and fewer side effects.",

        "abstract": "Vascular inflammation is present in many cardiovascular diseases, and exogenous glucocorticoids have traditionally been used as a therapy to suppress inflammation. However, recent data have shown that endogenous glucocorticoids, acting through the endothelial glucocorticoid receptor, act as negative regulators of inflammation. Here, we performed ChIP for the glucocorticoid receptor, followed by next-generation sequencing in mouse endothelial cells to investigate how the endothelial glucocorticoid receptor regulates vascular inflammation. We identified a role of the Wnt signaling pathway in this setting and show that loss of the endothelial glucocorticoid receptor results in upregulation of Wnt signaling both in vitro and in vivo using our validated mouse model. Furthermore, we demonstrate glucocorticoid receptor regulation of a key gene in the Wnt pathway, Frzb, via a glucocorticoid response element gleaned from our genomic data. These results suggest a role for endothelial Wnt signaling modulation in states of vascular inflammation.",

        "abstract": "The activation of two transcription factors, NF&#x3ba;B and NICD (notch intracellular domain), plays a crucial role in different stages of atherosclerotic disease progression, from early endothelial activation by modified lipids like oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxyLDL) to the imminent rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque. Inflammatory mediators and the notch pathway proteins were upregulated in atherogenic diet-induced rats and the same was confirmed by the differentiation of monocyte to macrophage on exposure to oxyLDL. The inflammatory transcription factor NF&#x3ba;B and the notch signaling transcription factor NICD were analysed for their molecular interaction in monocyte to macrophage differentiation. Inhibition of NF&#x3ba;B by dexamethasone in monocyte to macrophage differentiation resulted in a concomitant downregulation of NICD, whereas inhibition of NICD by N-(N-[3, 5-difluorophenacetyl])-l-alanyl)-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT), a &#x3b3;-secretase inhibitor, did not significantly influence the expression of NF&#x3ba;B, but downregulated macrophage differentiation. These findings revealed that NF&#x3ba;B inhibition using dexamethasone regulated NICD, which turned down macrophage differentiation. Thus, inhibition of both NF&#x3ba;B-NICD is a potential target for intervention in atherosclerosis.",

        "abstract": "In general, atherosclerosis is considered to be a form of chronic inflammation. Dexamethasone has anti-inflammatory effects in atherosclerosis, but it was not considered for long-term administration on account of a poor pharmacokinetic profile and adverse side effects. Nanoparticles in which drugs can be dissolved, encapsulated, entrapped or chemically attached to the particle surface have abilities to incorporate dexamethasone and to be used as controlled or targeted drug delivery system. Long circulatory polymeric nanoparticles present as an assisting approach for controlled and targeted release of the encapsulated drug at the atherosclerotic site. Polymeric nanoparticles combined with ultrasound (US) are widely applied in cancer treatment due to their time applications, low cost, simplicity, and safety. However, there are few studies on atherosclerosis treatment using polymeric nanoparticles combined with US. In this study, targeted dexamethasone acetate (DA)-loaded poly (lactide-glycolide)-polyethylene glycol-cRGD (PLGA-PEG-cRGD) nanoparticles (DA-PLGA-PEG-cRGD NPs) were prepared by the emulsion-evaporation method using cRGD modified PLGA-PEG polymeric materials (PLGA-PEG-cRGD) prepared as the carrier. The average particle size of DA-PLGA-PEG-cRGD NPs was 221.6 &#xb1; 0.9 nm. Morphology of the nanoparticles was spherical and uniformly dispersed. In addition, the DA released profiles suggested that ultrasound could promote drug release from the nanocarriers and accelerate the rate of release. In vitro, the cellular uptake process of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)@DA-PLGA-PEG-cRGD NPs combined with US into the damaged human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) indicated that US promoted rapid intracellular uptake of FITC@DA- PLGA-PEG-cRGD NPs. The cell viability of DA-PLGA-PEG-cRGD NPs combined with US reached 91.9% &#xb1; 0.2%, which demonstrated that DA-PLGA-PEG-cRGD NPs combined with US had a positive therapeutic effect on damaged HUVECs. Overall, DA-PLGA-PEG-cRGD NPs in combination with US may provide a promising drug delivery system to enhance the therapeutic effects of these chemotherapeutics at the cellular level.",

        "abstract": "Bone and vascular diseases are considered to share pathogenic mechanisms. Excess glucocorticoids, key regulators of cardiovascular and metabolic homeostasis, may promote both diseases simultaneously. We used endogenous Cushing's syndrome (CS) to investigate whether glucocorticoid excess underlies coexisting bone and vascular diseases. We included 194 patients with adrenal tumors (ATs): autonomous cortisol secretion (ACS, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;97) and non-functional AT (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;97). ACS was further classified into overt CS (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;17) and subclinical CS (SCS, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;80). Arterial stiffness was defined as a brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV)&#xa0;&#x2265;&#xa0;1800&#xa0;cm/s. Patients with ACS had higher coexistence rates of vertebral fracture and arterial stiffness (23&#xa0;% vs. 2&#xa0;%; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) and vertebral fracture and abdominal aortic calcification (22&#xa0;% vs. 1&#xa0;%; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) than those with non-functional AT. In patients with ACS, baPWV was negatively correlated with trabecular bone score (TBS, r&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.33; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.002), but not with bone mineral density, and vertebral fracture was associated with arterial stiffness in the logistic regression analysis. In the multivariate analysis of variance, the degree of cortisol excess (defined as CS, SCS, and non-functional AT) determined the correlation between TBS and baPWV (partial &#x3b7; 2 &#xa0;=&#xa0;0.07; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). In the analysis of covariance, patients with coexisting vertebral fracture and arterial stiffness had higher levels of serum cortisol after the 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test than those without. In endogenous glucocorticoid excess, bone and vascular diseases frequently coexisted, and deteriorated bone quality, not bone loss, was related to arterial stiffness. Thus, glucocorticoid excess may perturb the bone-vascular axis.",

        "abstract": "IgE has been known for mediating endothelial cell dysfunction and mast cell (MC) activation to fuel asthma-aggravated high-fat diet-induced atherosclerosis. However, it remains unclear for the mechanism of asthma-mediated atherosclerosis, especially the potential involvement of IgE in the exacerbation of asthma-mediated atherosclerosis with a standard laboratory diet, and the cross talk between endothelial cells and MCs. Asthma-mediated atherosclerosis mice models under a standard laboratory diet and Fc&#x3b5;R1 knock-out mice were used to determine the role of IgE-Fc&#x3b5;R1 signaling in asthma-mediated atherosclerosis, which was assessed by Oil Red O staining and immunohistochemistry. Various in vitro assays including nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy were used to evaluate exosome characteristics. Immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization approaches were used to evaluate the effect and mechanism of MC-secreted exosomes encapsulated circular RNA CDR1as (cerebellar degeneration-related 1 antisense) on endothelial cells in vivo and in vitro. Finally, cohort studies examined the plasma CDR1as levels in patients with atherosclerosis with or without allergies. Asthma mice with a standard laboratory diet showed increased atherosclerotic lesions and inflammatory infiltration depending on IgE-Fc&#x3b5;R1 signal. Fc&#x3b5;R1 knockout mice and blockage of IgE-Fc&#x3b5;R1 signaling with IgE monoclonal antibody, omalizumab, all significantly alleviated asthma-mediated atherosclerosis and vascular inflammatory remodeling. Anti-inflammation with dexamethasone and stabilization of MC with cromolyn partially alleviated atherosclerotic lesions and mitigated the inflammatory infiltration in arteries. Mechanistically, IgE stimulation upregulates MC CDR1as expression in exosomes and upregulates the endothelial cell adhesive factors VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) and ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1) via the CDR1as-FUS (fused in sarcoma)-phos-p65 axis. Knockdown of CDR1as in vivo significantly decreased the endothelial adhesion function and mitigated asthma-mediated atherosclerosis. Furthermore, a cohort study indicated higher plasma CDR1as levels in patients with atherosclerosis with allergies than in patients with atherosclerosis and healthy controls. Exosomes from IgE-stimulated MCs aggravated atherosclerosis through circular RNA CDR1as-mediated endothelial dysfunction, providing a novel insight into asthma-mediated atherosclerosis and potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets.",

Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an acute-phase protein, upregulated in sera of RA patients. To determine the effects of medications on SAA-stimulated human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC). HCAEC were preincubated for 2&#x2009;h with medications from sterile ampules (dexamethasone, methotrexate, certolizumab pegol, and etanercept), dissolved in medium (captopril) or DMSO (etoricoxib, rosiglitazone, meloxicam, fluvastatin, and diclofenac). Human recombinant apo-SAA was used to stimulate HCAEC at a final 1000&#x2009;nM concentration for 24&#x2009;hours. IL-6, IL-8, sVCAM-1, and PAI-1 were measured by ELISA. The number of viable cells was determined colorimetrically. SAA-stimulated levels of released IL-6, IL-8, and sVCAM-1 from HCAEC were significantly attenuated by methotrexate, fluvastatin, and etoricoxib. Both certolizumab pegol and etanercept significantly decreased PAI-1 by an average of 43%. Rosiglitazone significantly inhibited sVCAM-1 by 58%. We observed marked influence of fluvastatin on lowering cytokine production in SAA-activated HCAEC. Methotrexate showed strong beneficial effects for lowering released Il-6, IL-8, and sVCAM-1. Interesting duality was observed for NSAIDs, with meloxicam exhibiting opposite-trend effects from diclofenac and etoricoxib. This represents unique insight into specific responsiveness of inflammatory-driven HCAEC relevant to atherosclerosis.",

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality among postmenopausal women, with atherosclerosis being a major underlying factor. Endothelial dysfunction, a key initiating event in atherosclerosis, can be triggered by hormonal and metabolic changes. While estrogen deficiency has been linked to increased cardiovascular risk, the molecular mechanisms by which it exacerbates endothelial dysfunction, particularly in the presence of elevated glucocorticoid levels, remain poorly understood. This study aims to explore the role of FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5) in mediating glucocorticoid-induced endothelial dysfunction in estrogen-deficient females. Estrogen deficiency was developed in female mice by ovariectomy (OVX). Female mice and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with dexamethasone (DEX) to mimic elevated cortisol levels in vivo and vitro. Endothelial function of the mice aorta was assessed using wire myography. Oxidative stress and inflammation were evaluated through reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection, immunofluorescence and mRNA expression analysis. The selective FKBP5 inhibitor SAFit2 was used to study the functional role of FKBP5 in these processes. Estrogen deficiency contributed to endothelial dysfunction in female mice, an effect exacerbated by elevated glucocorticoid levels. FKBP5 expression was upregulated in both ovariectomized mice aortas and DEX-treated endothelial cells. Inhibition of FKBP5 reversed endothelial dysfunction, reduced ROS levels, and suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, including ICAM-1, IL-1&#x3b2;, TNF-&#x3b1;, and NF-&#x3ba;B. FKBP5 mediates glucocorticoid-induced endothelial dysfunction under estrogen-deficient conditions. Inhibition of FKBP5 represents a promising therapeutic strategy to ameliorate endothelial dysfunction and improve vascular health in estrogen-deficient women.",
