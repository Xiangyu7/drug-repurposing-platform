        "abstract": "The lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-1 (LOX-1) is a key scavenger receptor for oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (oxLDL), which promotes inflammation and atherosclerosis. Here we evaluated MEDI6570, an antibody that acts as a LOX-1 antagonist, in a randomized, double-blind, dose-finding study in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and residual inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;1&#x2009;mg&#x2009;l -1 ). At 30-365 days after MI, 423 patients (75 women, 348 men) were randomly allocated to 50&#x2009;mg, 150&#x2009;mg or 400&#x2009;mg MEDI6570 or placebo treatment subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary endpoint, the change in the noncalcified plaque volume in the most diseased coronary segment (NCPV MD ) by computed tomography angiography, was not significantly different between placebo and MEDI6570 at any dose. The secondary endpoints, global NCPV and low-attenuation plaque volume, were also not different between placebo and MEDI6570 at any dose (all placebo-adjusted comparisons, P&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). With regard to exploratory endpoints, there were reductions in free soluble LOX-1 (sLOX-1) from baseline by 44.8%, 85.8%, 94.0% and 96.4% in the placebo, 50&#x2009;mg, 150&#x2009;mg and 400&#x2009;mg dose arms, respectively (all placebo-adjusted comparisons P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels decreased by 2.9%, -3.0%, 18.9% and 21.5% in the placebo, 50&#x2009;mg, 150&#x2009;mg and 400&#x2009;mg arms, respectively, with substantial placebo-adjusted reductions observed only at 150&#x2009;mg and 400&#x2009;mg (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). MEDI6570 was well tolerated and rates of serious adverse events were similar in the MEDI6570 and placebo groups. In summary, despite favorable effects on sLOX-1 and IL-6, a LOX-1 inhibitor did not reduce noncalcified coronary plaque volume in patients with residual inflammation after acute MI.

        "abstract": "Background Blockade of the lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) is a potentially attractive mechanism for lowering inflammatory and lipid risk in patients with atherosclerosis. This study aims to assess the safety, tolerability, and target engagement of MEDI6570, a high-affinity monoclonal blocking antibody to LOX-1. Methods and Results This phase 1, first-in-human, placebo-controlled study (NCT03654313) randomized 88 patients with type 2 diabetes to receive single ascending doses (10, 30, 90, 250, or 500&#x2009;mg) or multiple ascending doses (90, 150, or 250&#x2009;mg once monthly for 3&#x2009;months) of MEDI6570 or placebo. Primary end point was safety; secondary and exploratory end points included pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, free soluble LOX-1 levels, and change in coronary plaque volume. Mean age was 57.6/58.1&#x2009;years in the single ascending doses/multiple ascending doses groups, 31.3%/62.5% were female, and mean type 2 diabetes duration was 9.7/8.7&#x2009;years. Incidence of adverse events was similar among cohorts. MEDI6570 exhibited nonlinear pharmacokinetics, with terminal half-life increasing from 4.6&#x2009;days (30&#x2009;mg) to 11.2&#x2009;days (500&#x2009;mg), consistent with target-mediated drug disposition. Dose-dependent reductions in mean soluble LOX-1 levels from baseline were observed (&gt;66% at 4&#x2009;weeks and 71.61-82.96% at 10&#x2009;weeks in the single ascending doses and multiple ascending doses groups, respectively). After 3 doses, MEDI6570 was associated with nonsignificant regression of noncalcified plaque volume versus placebo (-13.45&#x2009;mm 3 versus -8.25&#x2009;mm 3 ). Conclusions MEDI6570 was well tolerated and demonstrated dose-dependent soluble LOX-1 suppression and a pharmacokinetic profile consistent with once-monthly dosing.
